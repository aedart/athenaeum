For whatever reasons, you may have to continue development of new features in an outdated system. Ultimately, you may wish to start from scratch and make use of all the tools and frameworks you desire. This may even prove to be the best choice in the long run. Unfortunately, such a choice isn&#39;t always available, and you have to make due with whatever you have. In other words, at the end of the day, you still have to get the job done.</p><p>Nevertheless, to make some tasks easier, perhaps you choose to make due with a few of Laravel&#39;s packages. But when a few packages (or services) become a handful, then it can become somewhat tricky or cumbersome trying to setup those services, when you lack Laravel&#39;s native mechanisms; <em>the ability to register and boot service providers.</em></p><p>This package was created to offer such a mechanism, in hopes that it can bridge the gab between you legacy application and some of Laravel&#39;s packages. However, you must understand that <strong>it is not a replacement for Laravel framework!</strong></p><h3 id="why-not-include-the-entire-framework" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#why-not-include-the-entire-framework" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Why not include the entire Framework?</h3><p>Should you be able to include the entire Laravel Framework in your vendor, and you are able to achieve your goals within your legacy application, then please do so. Laravel is incredible powerful. If you spend enough time reviewing it&#39;s source code, you might be surprised just how flexible it actually is. Consequently, if such a choice is available to you, then you shouldn&#39;t have any need for this package.</p><p>Regardless, please bare in mind that no framework can solve every kind of problem or challenge. Nor would it be fair, to demand it&#39;s authors and contributes to solve all of your challenges, when dealing with legacy applications. Not even this package will be able to solve all problems. It only offers a &quot;minimum&quot; set of functionality, hopefully allowing you to bring some of Laravel&#39;s capabilities, services and components into your legacy application. How you choose to make use of it, if at all, is entirely up to you.</p><h2 id="limitations" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#limitations" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Limitations</h2><p>When comparing this package&#39;s deliverables, with the application offered by Laravel, it has an abundance of limitations. To illustrate some of these limitations, consider the following major unsupported features:</p><h3 id="no-http-request-response-support" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#no-http-request-response-support" aria-hidden="true">#</a> No Http Request / Response Support</h3><p>Presumably your legacy application already has it&#39;s own way of dealing with Http Requests and Responses. Trying to redesign your application to support a different request and response mechanism, might prove to be very difficult, when the architecture is already established. Therefore, this application does not offer any support for such. In other words, it does not impose you to change your already established request and response handling.</p><h3 id="no-frontend-support" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#no-frontend-support" aria-hidden="true">#</a> No Frontend Support</h3>',12),I={href:"https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/blade",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},A=a("h3",{id:"no-database-support",tabindex:"-1"},[a("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#no-database-support","aria-hidden":"true"},"#"),e(" No Database Support")],-1),C={href:"https://www.php.net/manual/en/class.pdo",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},R={href:"https://www.php.net/manual/en/class.mysqli.php",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},F={href:"https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/eloquent",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},T={href:"https://packagist.org/packages/illuminate/database",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},P=a("h3",{id:"other-limitations",tabindex:"-1"},[a("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#other-limitations","aria-hidden":"true"},"#"),e(" Other Limitations")],-1),N={href:"https://github.com/laravel/framework/blob/6.x/src/Illuminate/Contracts/Foundation/Application.php",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},S=a("code",null,"\\Illuminate\\Contracts\\Foundation\\Application",-1),E=a("h2",{id:"alternatives",tabindex:"-1"},[a("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#alternatives","aria-hidden":"true"},"#"),e(" Alternatives")],-1),H=a("h3",{id:"laravel-framework-or-lumen",tabindex:"-1"},[a("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#laravel-framework-or-lumen","aria-hidden":"true"},"#"),e(" Laravel Framework or Lumen")],-1),B={href:"https://laravel.com/",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},M={href:"https://lumen.laravel.com/",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},D=a("em",null,"E.g. you may not have this choice available",-1),V=a("em",null,"continuing to add features into a legacy application will increase complexity.",-1),j=a("em",null,"or Lumen",-1),O={href:"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},U=a("h3",{id:"other-frameworks",tabindex:"-1"},[a("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#other-frameworks","aria-hidden":"true"},"#"),e(" Other Frameworks")],-1),W={href:"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:PHP_frameworks",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"};function Y(G,z){const o=r("ExternalLinkIcon"),n=r("RouterLink");return s(),l("div",null,[p,a("p",null,[e("The Athenaeum Core Application is a custom implementation of "),a("a",u,[e("Laravel's"),t(o)]),e(),a("a",m,[f,t(o)]),e(".
