* Adapted CI environment to test PHP `v8.1` and `v8.2`.
* Upgraded to use Laravel `v10.x` packages.
* `FieldFilter` constructor and `make()` method arguments are now optional, to allow creating instances without triggering immediate validation of field, operator and value.
* `DateFilter::allowedDateFormats()` visibility changed to public and now returns default date / datetime formats, when none specified.
* `ApiResourceServiceProvider` changed to be an aggregate service provider that automatically registers `ETagsServiceProvider`.
* `SearchFilter` no longer applies unnecessary query constraint (_the first comparison constraint_).
* Dispatching "multiple models changed", via `ModelChangedEvents::dispatchMultipleModelsChanged` no longer skips all models, if the first is marked as "skip next recording", in audit package.

* Switched to [`xxHash`](https://php.watch/versions/8.1/xxHash) as default hashing algorithm in etags `BaseGenerator` and example configuration.
* Temporary and public URL tests for database adapter are forced to evaluate to true. Original tests marked them as skipped, because features are not supported.
* Extracted translation utilities into own trait in `BaseRule`, which now allow setting translation key prefix (_vendor prefix_). [#114](https://github.com/aedart/athenaeum/issues/114).
* Extracted `$attribute` into own trait in `BaseRule`. Can now be set or obtained via appropriate getter and setter methods.
* `MicroTimeStamp::fromDateTime()` now accepts `\DateTimeInterface` instead of `\DateTime`.
* `Duration` now accepts `\DateTimeInterface` instead of `\DateTime`.
* `RequestETagsMixin::httpDateFrom()` now parses Http Date acc. to RFC9110 (_a looser date format parsing was previously used_).
* Response `Status` interface  now extends `\Stringable` (_Http Clients package_).
* Response `Status` now guesses a status phrase when none given.

### Fixed

* `DatetimeFilter` does not accept dates formatted as RFC3339 with `"Z"` (_Zulu_).

* Replaced `fzaninotto/faker` package with `fakerphp/faker`. [#23](https://github.com/aedart/athenaeum/issues/23).
* Replaced property calls with method calls, on faker instance throughout many tests (_PHP faker deprecated several properties since `v1.14`_). [#23](https://github.com/aedart/athenaeum/issues/23).  
* Upgraded to [Symplify Monorepo Builder](https://github.com/symplify/monorepo-builder) `v10.x`. [#60](https://github.com/aedart/athenaeum/issues/60), [#65](https://github.com/aedart/athenaeum/pull/65).
* `\Aedart\Utils\Dates\Duration` now inherits from `Stringable`.
* `castAsDate()` now also accepts `DateTimeInterface` as argument, in `ArrayDto`. [#82](https://github.com/aedart/athenaeum/issues/82)
* Replaced `get_class()` calls with the use of new `::class` magic constant (_[introduced in PHP 8](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.basic.php#language.oop5.basic.class.class)_). Change is throughout all packages.
* Replaced [Travis](https://www.travis-ci.com/) with [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) as CI service. [#102](https://github.com/aedart/athenaeum/issues/102)
* Contribution guide has been improved. [#97](https://github.com/aedart/athenaeum/issues/97).

### Removed

* `\Aedart\Filters\Query\Filters\Concerns\StopWords` has been removed. Component didn't work as intended and caused several issues. [#63](https://github.com/aedart/athenaeum/issues/63).
* `$language` argument from `\Aedart\Filters\Query\Filters\SearchFilter` (_was deprecated in `v5.25`_). [#63](https://github.com/aedart/athenaeum/issues/63).
* `undot()` from `\Aedart\Utils\Arr`. The `undot()` method has been implemented in Laravel's `Arr`, which acts as the base class for `\Aedart\Utils\Arr`. This change is not breaking.
* `terminating()` method from `\Aedart\Contracts\Core\Application`. Method is defined in Laravel's Application interfaces, which the core application inherits from.
* `configurationIsChanged()`, `getCachedConfigPath()`, `getCachedServicesPath()`, `getCachedPackagesPath()`, `getCachedRoutesPath()` and `routesAreCached()` methods from
Core `Application` (_methods were not supported to begin with. They were defined by Laravel's `Applicaiton` interface, but extracted into separate interfaces from `v9.x`_). [#86](https://github.com/aedart/athenaeum/pull/86).
* `audit-trail.listener` setting, in `/configs/audit-trail.php` configuration (_was deprecated in `v5.27`_).
* `MocksApplicationServices` removed from `AthenaeumTestHelper` and `LaravelTestHelper`. The "mock application services" helper has been deprecated by Laravel.

### Fixed

* `storagePath()` must be compatible with interface declared method, in `\Aedart\Core\Application` (_method was changed in Laravel `v9.x`_).
* Input value "filter" contains a non-scalar value, when attempting get array value from http query via inside `\Aedart\Filters\BaseProcessor::value()` (_happened after upgrade to the latest version Laravel / Symfony_). [#69](https://github.com/aedart/athenaeum/issues/69).
* Unexpected value for parameter "name": expecting "array". [#71](https://github.com/aedart/athenaeum/issues/71).
* Incorrect commit reference passed on to `\Jean85\Version`, in `\Aedart\Utils\Version` (_happened after upgrade to the latest version of "Pretty Package Versions"_).
* Schedule commands not registered in Core Application's console `Kernel` / Artisan. [#84](https://github.com/aedart/athenaeum/pull/84).
* `\Illuminate\Support\ServiceProvider` imported into `\Aedart\Contracts\Service\Registrar` interface. This created unintended dependency on Laravel package.
* `\Illuminate\Filesystem\Filesystem` imported into `\Aedart\Contracts\Support\Helpers\Filesystem\FileAware` interface. This created unintended dependency on Laravel package.
* `\Illuminate\Http\Request` imported into `\Aedart\Contracts\Support\Helpers\Http\RequestAware` interface. This created unintended dependency on Laravel package.
* `\Illuminate\Log\LogManager` imported into `\Aedart\Contracts\Support\Helpers\Logging\LogManagerAware` interface. This created unintended dependency on Laravel package.
* `\Illuminate\Routing\Redirector` imported into `\Aedart\Contracts\Support\Helpers\Routing\RedirectAware` interface. This created unintended dependency on Laravel package.
* `\Illuminate\Session\SessionManager` imported into `\Aedart\Contracts\Support\Helpers\Session\SessionManagerAware` interface. This created unintended dependency on Laravel package.
* `\Illuminate\View\Compilers\BladeCompiler` imported into `\Aedart\Contracts\Support\Helpers\View\BladeAware` interface. This created unintended dependency on Laravel package.
* `$_ENV['APP_ENV']` and `$_SERVER['APP_ENV']` not unset after each Application test, causing environment detecting tests to fail, in `\Aedart\Testing\Athenaeum\ApplicationInitiator`.
* `Codeception\TestCase\Test` class not found, in `\Aedart\Tests\Integration\Laravel\ApplicationInitiatorTest` (_happened after upgrade to the latest version of Codeception_). 
* `LoadSpecifiedConfiguration` may not inherit from final class. `\Aedart\Testing\Laravel\Bootstrap\LoadSpecifiedConfiguration` no longer inherits from `Orchestra\Testbench\Bootstrap\LoadConfiguration`, which has been declared final (_happened after upgrade to the latest version of Orchestra_).

## [5.27.0] - 2022-01-31

### Added

* `MultipleModelsChanged` event in Audit package.
* `RecordMultipleAuditTrailEntries` listener that handles `MultipleModelsChanged` events. Performs a mass insert of audit trail entries.
* `AuditTrailEventSubscriber` that will handle registration of Audit Trail related event listeners.

### Deprecated

* The `audit-trail.listener` configuration setting has been replaced with `audit-trail.subscriber`, in `configs/audit-trail.php`.
Will be removed in next major version (_in audit package_).

### Changed

* `ModelChangedEvents` concern is now able to dispatch "multiple models changed" event, via `dispatchMultipleModelsChanged()` (_in audit package_).

### Fixed

* `$performedAt` argument ignored in `\Aedart\Audit\Events\ModelHasChanged`.

## [5.26.0] - 2022-01-03

### Changed

* Bumped license year.

## [5.25.0] - 2021-12-14

### Changed

* Replaced [`ReflectionParameter::getClass`](https://www.php.net/manual/en/reflectionparameter.getclass.php) call in `IoCPartial` and `ArgumentFaker` with an alternative, because it's deprecated since PHP `v8.0`. [#61](https://github.com/aedart/athenaeum/issues/61).
* Replaced `socket_create()` call with `tempfile()`, in `JsonTest`. From PHP `v8.0`, the `socket_create()` method returns an object, which can be encoded to Json and thus defeats the purpose of the test. [#61](https://github.com/aedart/athenaeum/issues/61).
* Converting test model's primary key and auditable id to `string`, to avoid incorrect value comparison in PHP `v8.1`, in the `B0_AuditTrailTest`. [#61](https://github.com/aedart/athenaeum/issues/61).
* Upgraded phpcs, easy-coding-standard and other vendor-bin dependencies.

### Fixed

* Removal of stop words causes search results to become undesired. `SearchFilter` no longer automatically removes stop words search term. [#63](https://github.com/aedart/athenaeum/issues/63).

### Deprecated

* The `StopWords` concern has now been deprecated and `SearchFilter` no longer automatically removes anything from given search term. [#63](https://github.com/aedart/athenaeum/issues/63).

## [5.24.2] - 2021-12-10

### Fixed

* `required` validation rule triggered, despite valid value given in `DateFilter`. This happened only when field contained a table name prefix, e.g. "users.created_at".

## [5.24.1] - 2021-12-09

### Fixed

* Unable to use string value in `BelongsToFilter`, due to incorrect assertion.

## [5.24.0] - 2021-12-08

### Added

* `BelongsToFilter` that is able to constrain relations of the type "belongs to", in filters package.

### Changed

* Allowing `FieldCriteria` instances to be given in the `fitlers()`, in `ConstraintsProcessor`. This allows for more advanced filters setup.
* Example of `BaseFiltersBuilder` now uses a custom method for the sortable properties to columns map, in documentation.

## [5.23.0] - 2021-12-02

### Added

* `DateFilter` that is able to match dates stated in `Y-m-d` format.
* `UTCDatetimeFilter` converts given date to UTC, before attempts to match against database value.

### Fixed

* `DatetimeFilter` fails matching full date and time. New comparison logic has been added. Previously used Laravel's `whereDate()` query, which yielded incorrect results.

## [5.22.4] - 2021-11-29

### Fixed

* `SearchFilter` not applied when `'0'` given as search term.

## [5.22.3] - 2021-11-29

### Fixed

* `SearchProcessor` not applied when `'0'` given as search term.

## [5.22.2] - 2021-11-24

### Fixed

* Incorrect value assertion for `NumericFilter`, when `is_null` or `not_null` operators used.
* Applies list of numeric values validation, when neither `in` or `not_in` operator set, in `NumericFilter`.

## [5.22.1] - 2021-11-18

### Fixed

* Too aggressive stop-word removal, removes more than it should, in Filters package's `StopWords` concern.

## [5.22.0] - 2021-11-17

### Added

* Filters package. Offers a way to create query filters, based on received http query parameters. [#59](https://github.com/aedart/athenaeum/pull/59).

## [5.21.0] - 2021-11-05

### Added

* Query `Filter` and `FieldFilter` abstractions, in database package.
* `Filtering` concern for Eloquent models, in database package.

## [5.20.0] - 2021-09-09

### Added

* `all()` method in `RedmineApiResource`, which is able to automatically paginate through all available results. [#53](https://github.com/aedart/athenaeum/pull/53).

### Fixed

* Unable to run database migrations in tests. [#55](https://github.com/aedart/athenaeum/issues/55).

## [5.19.0] - 2021-09-07

### Added

* Redmine API Client package. [#52](https://github.com/aedart/athenaeum/pull/52).
* `fresh()` method in the Http Clients `Manger`; able to return a fresh Http `Client` instance, without having the instance cached. _The method is not yet supported by the `\Aedart\Contracts\Http\Clients\Manager` interface_.

### Changed

* `BaseSerializer` (_Http Message package_) will now re-encode json payloads with the `JSON_PRETTY_PRINT` set, if a message's if `content-type` header contains `/json` or `+json`. This makes it easier to read json payloads, in debugging situations.

### Fixed

* Call to undefined `GuzzleHttp\Psr7\parse_query()`, in the `C1_QueryTest` Http Client tests. [#49](https://github.com/aedart/athenaeum/issues/49).
* A few broken links (_incorrect paths_) in the documentation.

## [5.18.1] - 2021-07-13

### Fixed

* Array to string conversion error when comparing arrays, that contain nested empty arrays - in `Arr::differenceAssoc()`. [#47](https://github.com/aedart/athenaeum/issues/47).

## [5.18.0] - 2021-06-30

### Added

* `SemanticVersion` validation rule.

## [5.17.0] - 2021-06-28

### Added

* `differenceAssoc()` method in `Arr`. Able to compute the difference of multidimensional arrays.

## [5.16.0] - 2021-05-26

### Added

* `formatOriginalData()` and `formatChangedData()`, in  the `RecordsChanges` trait. This allows easier changes to the attributes / data to be stored in an Audit Trail entry.

### Changed

* `originalData()` and `changedData()` now invoke the new format data methods, in the `RecordsChanges` trait, Audit package.

## [5.15.0] - 2021-05-07

### Changed

**Breaking Changes**

* `AuditTrailServiceProvider` now publishes migrations rather than loading them directly. This allows changing to installation order (_migration file's timestamp_).

**Caution**: _These changes can affect rolling back migrations. Please (re)publish service provider's assets to ensure your application is able to roll back the `create_audit_trail_table` migration._

### Fixed

* Fails inserting a new audit trail entry into database when user no longer exists, in `RecordAuditTrailEntry` listener.
  User existence is now checked before inserting new entry. If the user does not exist, then `null` is set as the audit trail entry's user reference.

## [5.14.1] - 2021-05-06

### Fixed

* Update events were not triggered / dispatched correctly, because they were invoked after database transactions, in `ModelObserver` from the Audit package.
  Changed the `$afterCommit` to `false` as the default value, to overcome this issue.

## [5.14.0] - 2021-05-06

### Added

* Possibility to skip recording a model's changes, via the `skipRecordingNextChange` method, in `RecordsChanges` trait.

## [5.13.2] - 2021-05-05

### Fixed

* Soft-deleted models not able to be eager-loaded in `AuditTrail` model (_auditable relation_).

## [5.13.1] - 2021-05-04

### Fixed

* Incorrect `performed_at` date time value for `AuditTrail` records. Previously relied on a model's `updated_at` value, which might not be accurate due depending upon when a "model has changed" event is dispatched (E.g. before or after an operation).
  In other words, a previous / past `updated_at` value could be applied, which would be incorrect and inconsistent of with when a given event or action was performed.
  `performed_at` value no defaults to current date time.

## [5.13.0] - 2021-04-29

### Changed

* Extracted timestamp attributes names into own method, in `RecordsChanges` trait (_Audit package_), so that they can be obtained easier. This should allow better customisation of which fields to hide for Audit Trail entries.

## [5.12.0] - 2021-04-28

### Added

* Audit package; a way to automatically record Eloquent Model changes. [#43](https://github.com/aedart/athenaeum/pull/43)
* `Invoker` component, in `Utils` package.

## [5.11.0] - 2021-04-19

### Added

* Documentation for the ACL package. [#35](https://github.com/aedart/athenaeum/issues/35).
* Documentation for the validation package. [#38](https://github.com/aedart/athenaeum/issues/38).
* Documentation for the database package. [#36](https://github.com/aedart/athenaeum/issues/36).

### Fixed

* Incorrect permissions check, in `\Aedart\Acl\Traits\HasRoles::hasPermission`. Was unable to grant permission to a user, if permission was granted to multiple roles.

## [5.10.1] - 2021-03-25

### Fixed

* Fix ACL models not respecting database connection in transactions. In situations when a custom connection was set or resolved, the ALC Permissions `Group` and `Role` didn't use that given connection in their custom creation or update methods.

## [5.10.0] - 2021-03-25

### Added

* Several tests to verify behaviour of `Slugs` concern, in Database package. [#39](https://github.com/aedart/athenaeum/issues/39).
* `createWithPermissions()` and `updateWithPermissions()` helper methods in ACL `Role` Eloquent model. [#41](https://github.com/aedart/athenaeum/pull/41).

### Changed

* Removed unnecessary `$slug` merge into `$values` parameter in `Slugs::findOrCreateBySlug`, in Database package. [#40](https://github.com/aedart/athenaeum/pull/40).
* Replaced manual transaction rollback handling in `createWithPermissions()` method, inside ACL Permissions `Group` model. Now using Laravel's `DB::transaction()` method instead. [#41](https://github.com/aedart/athenaeum/pull/41).

## [5.9.0] - 2021-03-23

### Added

* Validation package that is intended to offer various rules and other validation related utilities. Presently, it only contains an `AlphaDashDot` rule. [#37](https://github.com/aedart/athenaeum/pull/37).

## [5.8.0] - 2021-03-21

### Added

* ACL package which offers a way to store roles and permissions (grouped) in a database. [#34](https://github.com/aedart/athenaeum/pull/34).
* Database utilities package. [#34](https://github.com/aedart/athenaeum/pull/34).
* `Sluggable` interface and `Slug` concern in new Database package.
* `Str` utility, which offers a few additional string manipulation methods.

### Fixed

* Unable to run database migrations via `LaravelTestCase`. Now implements `\Orchestra\Testbench\Contracts\TestCase`, which resolves the issue¹.

¹: _Orchestra's `MigrateProcessor` component, which is used behind the scene, has an explicit `TestCase` dependency. This cannot be circumvented without extensive overwrites of several migration helper methods._

## [5.7.0] - 2021-03-16

### Added

* `application()` method in `\Aedart\Utils\Version`, which is able to return application's version. [#25](https://github.com/aedart/athenaeum/issues/25)

### Fixed

* Too many Chrome driver processes started in `BrowserTestCase`, possibly causing a `Connection Refused` error. [#33](https://github.com/aedart/athenaeum/issues/33)

## [5.6.0] - 2021-02-20

### Added

* Collections package, with `Summation` and `ItemProcessor` components. [#27](https://github.com/aedart/athenaeum/issues/27)
* `undot()` method in `Arr` utility.

## [5.5.1] - 2021-02-10

### Fixed

* Incorrect teardown order in `BrowserTestCase`

## [5.5.0] - 2021-02-10

### Fixed

* Facade root not set during test teardown, in `LaravelTestCase` and `ApplicationInitiator`¹.
* Laravel's `Application` still bound as `IoC`'s static instance, causing strange behaviour in some tests².

¹: _The happened sometime after Laravel released the "parallel testing" feature and Orchestra Testbench enabled it._
²: _Unintended side effect of fixing the `ApplicationInitiator`._

### Changed

* Bumped license year, in `LICENSE` files.
* Minimum required [Orchestra Testbench](https://packagist.org/packages/orchestra/testbench) set to `v6.12.x`.

## [5.4.0] - 2021-01-08

### Changed

* `ApplicationInitiator` now makes use of custom `LoadSpecifiedConfiguration`.
  A previously added, but not applied specialisation of Orchestra `LoadConfiguration`.
  Custom component allows specifying the location of configuration files to be loaded, via `getBasePath()` and `getConfigPath()` methods¹.

¹: _This change will implicit ensure that changes to `LoadConfiguration` will be caught by tests and thereby prevent defects that resulted in patches `v5.3.3` to `v5.3.5`._

## [5.3.5] - 2021-01-06

### Fixed

* Incorrect format yield from `getConfigurationFiles` method, in `LoadSpecifiedConfiguration` Testing utility¹.

¹: _Was in a hurry to fix a "minor" defect, which just caused several other minor defects._

## [5.3.4] - 2021-01-06

### Fixed

* `getConfigurationFiles` method still returned `array` instead of specified `Generator`, in `LoadSpecifiedConfiguration` Testing utility.

## [5.3.3] - 2021-01-06

### Fixed

* Incorrect return type for `getConfigurationFiles` method, in `LoadSpecifiedConfiguration` Testing utility.

## [5.3.2] - 2020-12-28

### Fixed

* Boundary values incorrectly shown when using `toHoursMinutes()` and `toMinutesSeconds()`, in `Duration` utility. 
E.g. when attempting to convert -2700 seconds to hours and minutes, the `toHoursMinutes()` method return 00:45, instead of -00:45.

## [5.3.1] - 2020-12-28

### Fixed

* `toHoursMinutes()` not able to show above 24 hours, in `Duration` utility.
* `toMinutesSeconds()` not able to show above 60 minutes, in `Duration` utility.

Both methods failed showing a correct amount, whenever the initial value surpassed 24 hours (_or 60 minutes for `toMinutesSeconds()`_).

## [5.3.0] - 2020-12-27

### Added

* `fromHoursMinutes` and `fromStringHoursMinutes` methods in `Duration` utility.

### Changed

* Laravel `v8.15.x` packages are now required as a minimum.
* Updated [Orchestra Testbench](https://github.com/orchestral/testbench-core) dependencies to `v6.9.x`.
* Added leading zero for `Durataion::toHoursMinutes` short format.
* Disabled `failsIfCacheIsNotLockProvider` test, since botch file and null cache drivers [now support locks](https://github.com/laravel/framework/blob/8.x/CHANGELOG-8.x.md#v8150-2020-11-17).

## [5.2.1] - 2020-11-09

### Fixed

* Invalid `$this` reference in `static function`, in `DuskTestHelper`.
* Call to unknown `makeChromeOptions()` method.

## [5.2.0] - 2020-11-09

### Added

* `LoadSpecifiedConfiguration` bootstrapper, in `Testing` package. Intended for Laravel and Laravel Dusk tests.
* `$browserSourceOutput` property. Location where a page's source code is to be stored, in `DuskTestHelper`.

### Changed

* Switched back to `ChromeOptions::CAPABILITY` (_which is deprecated_), because `ChromeOptions::CAPABILITY_W3C` ignores command line arguments for Chrome Driver, in `DuskTestHelper`.
* Extracted configuration loader binding into own method / property, in `DuskTestHelper`. This makes it easier to overwrite, when needed.

## [5.1.0] - 2020-10-16

### Added

* Added `DuskTestHelper` and `BrowserTestCase` helpers, which offers integration to [Laravel Dusk](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/dusk).

### Changed

* Changed `LaravelTestHelper`, added `InteractsWithTime` ([Laravel's helper](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/mocking#interacting-with-time)) and `InteractsWithViews`. [#20](https://github.com/aedart/athenaeum/issues/20).

## [5.0.2] - 2020-10-06

### Fixed

* Incorrect code style caused CI failure.

## [5.0.1] - 2020-10-06

### Fixed

* Http Message stream not rewound after serialization, when using `debug()`, `dd()` or `log()`. See [#19](https://github.com/aedart/athenaeum/issues/19) for details.
* Removed deprecated `CreateAwareOfCommand` reference from `athenaeum` console application.
* Fixed a few typos.

## [5.0.0] - 2020-10-04

### Added

* Added `ListResolver` component.
* Added `otherwise()` and `getOtherwise()` methods to Circuit Breaker.
* Http `Client` (_via Request `Builder`_) is now able to process `Middleware`.
* Added `Middleware` and `Handler` components for Http Client. Inspired by [PSR-15](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-15/).
* Added `QueueHandler`, a middleware processing component for Http Client Requests.
* Added `AppliesResponseExpectations` middleware. Replacement for internal response expectations handling in Http `Client`.
* Added `ResponseExpectation` component.
* Added Http Message `Serializer` components, in `Aedart\Http\Messages` namespace.
* Added `RequestResponseDebugging` Middleware for Http `Client`.
* Support for loading [TOML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOML) configuration files.
* Added Http Request `Builder` aware of component.
* Added `Duration` utility.
* PHP Compatibility check in Travis.

### Removed

* Removed internal `applyExpectations()` method from `Expectations` concern, in Http Client `Builder`. Has been replaced by `AppliesResponseExpectations` middleware.
* Removed `Aedart\Dto` (_was deprecated in `v4.x`_).
* Removed `Aedart\ArrayDto` (_was deprecated in `v4.x`_).
* Removed `Aedart\Console\CreateAwareOfCommand` (_was deprecated in `v4.x`_).
* Removed `Aedart\Console\CommandBase` (_was deprecated in `v4.x`_).
* Removed `Aedart\Console\AwareOfScaffoldCommand` (_was deprecated in `v4.x`_).
* Removed all helpers in `Aedart\Support\Properties\Mixed\*` namespace (_was deprecated in `v4.x`_).
* Removed all contracts in `Aedart\Contracts\Support\Properties\Mixed\*` namespace (_was deprecated in `v4.x`_).

### Changed

**Breaking Changes**

* Upgraded Laravel dependencies to `v8.x`.
* Added `bootstrap()` method in `\Aedart\Core\Console\Kernel`, due to Laravel's Console `Kernal` interface change. `runCore()` method will now invoke new bootstrap method.
* `getExpectations()` now returns array of `ResponseExpectation` instances, in Request `Builder`.
* Changed `StatusCodesExpectation`, now inherits from `ResponseExpectation`. Some internal methods have been redesigned. This change should not affect your code, unless you have custom Http Request `Builder` implementation.
* Changed `withExpectation()`, in Request `Builder`. Now accepts both a `callable` and a `ResponseExpectation` instance. This change should not affect your code, unless you have custom Http Request `Builder` implementation.
* Changed Request `Builder` and Http `Client` interfaces and concrete implementations. Now offers methods for adding `Middleware`. This change only affects you if you have a custom Http `Client` or Request `Builder` implementation.
* Changed Http `Client` and Request `Builder`, added debugging methods (`debug()`, `dd()`, `log()`...etc). This change only affects you if you have a custom Http `Client` or Request `Builder` implementation.

**Non-breaking Changes**

* Added shortcut methods (_`getClient()` and `client()`_) for obtaining Http Client instance in `ProcessOptions`.
* Changed `HttpClientServiceProvider`, now inherits from the `AggregateServiceProvider` and registers the `HttpSerializationServiceProvider` automatically. This eliminates setup of debugging components, for the Http `Client`.

### Fixed

* Fixed incorrect type declarations in PHPDoc (_throughout various components_).
* Codeception broken after update (_in codeception version 4.1.x series_).

## [4.2.1] - 2020-07-31

### Security

* Bumped minimum required dependencies, due to [security issue / release from Laravel](https://blog.laravel.com/laravel-cookie-security-releases).

## [4.2.0] - 2020-07-05

### Added

* Circuits package that offers a `CircuitBreaker`, with a `Manager` (profile-based).

## [4.1.0] - 2020-04-22

### Added

* `LaravelExceptionHandler` adaptor

### Fixed

* Unable to run `schedule:run` command. [#10](https://github.com/aedart/athenaeum/issues/10)

### Changed

* Minimum required Laravel packages version set to version `^7.7`


## [4.0.1] - 2020-04-15

### Fixed

* Broken interdependencies in all packages. Removed version `v4.0` from packagist.org to prevent conflicts.

### Added

* `Application`, custom adaptation of Laravel's Application.
* `Kernel`, custom adaptation of Laravel's Console Application (Artisan).
* `Registrar`, able to register service providers.

* `MailManagerAware` and `MailManagerTrait` Laravel Aware-of Helper.
* Http- `ClientFactoryAware` and `ClientFactoryTrait` Laravel Aware-of Helper.
* `Cookie` and `SetCookie` DTOs.

### Deprecated

* Deprecated `\Aedart\Console\CommandBase`, `\Aedart\Console\AwareOfScaffoldCommand` and `\Aedart\Console\CreateAwareOfCommand` components.
  Commands have been replaced with updated versions within the [`aedart/athenaeum-support `](https://packagist.org/packages/aedart/athenaeum-support) package.
  The original commands are still available using the `athenaeum` console application.
* Deprecated all aware-of helpers that contained `*\Mixed\*` in their namespace.
  These will be removed in next major version.
  Replacement components are available within the `*\Mixes\*` namespace.
  The term `Mixed` has been a [soft-reserved keyword](https://www.php.net/manual/en/reserved.other-reserved-words.php) since PHP `v7.0`.

### Changed

**Breaking Changes**

* Required PHP version changed to `v7.4.x`.
* Upgraded Laravel dependencies to `v7.6.x`, Symfony to `v5.0.x`, Codeception to `v4.1.x`, and various other dependencies.
* All class properties now have their [types declared](https://www.php.net/manual/en/migration74.new-features.php#migration74.new-features.core.typed-properties), if possible.
* `dto:create` command now generates traits with class [type declarations](https://www.php.net/manual/en/migration74.new-features.php#migration74.new-features.core.typed-properties) for its properties (_former `dto:create-aware-of` command_).
* `Dto` and `ArrayDto` now implements the `__serialize()` and `__unserialize()` magic methods.
* Replaced `\Aedart\Dto` with `\Aedart\Dto\Dto`¹.
* Replaced `\Aedart\ArrayDto` with `\Aedart\Dto\ArrayDto`¹.
* [Codeception](https://github.com/Codeception/Codeception) and [Orchestra Testbench](https://github.com/orchestral/testbench) are now defined as dev-dependencies.
  You need to require these packages, if you depended on them².
* (_Fix_) `IoC` no longer high-jacks Laravel's `app` binding automatically, when `getInstance()` is invoked.
  This was used to get some of Laravel's components to work outside the scope of a Laravel application.
  Yet, this was a "hack" that potentially could lead to conflicted with Laravel. This was never intended³!
* Redesign entire Http `Client` package, now makes use of a Request Builder and Http Query Builder.

**Non-breaking Changes**

* Converted athenaeum into a true [mono repository](ttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo). All major components are now available as separate packages, via composer.
* Code style to [PSR-12](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/).
* Replaced deprecated `Twig` components, in `TwigPartial` trait.
* `UnitTestCase` now uses `FakerPartial` for setup [Faker](https://github.com/fzaninotto/Faker).
* `UnitTestCase` now inherits from Codeception's `Unit` test-case.
* Using `IoCFacade` to resolve default Http Client `Manager`, in `HttpClientsManagerTrait`.
* Added `\Aedart\Contracts\Container\IoC` and `\Illuminate\Contracts\Container\Container` as `app` binding aliases, in `IoC`³.
* Added possibility to specify specific `vendor` and `output` paths for `interfaces` and `traits`, in the aware-of `Generator`.
* `getHeader()` is now case-insensitive, in `DefaultHttpClient` and `JsonHttpClient`.
  Handling of headers is now more inline with [PSR-7](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7/#12-http-headers).
* Added `data_format` option for Http Clients.

¹: _Deprecation of existing abstractions or components is due to the conversion of this package into a [mono repository](ttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo).
Existing abstractions are still available, yet will be removed entirely in `v5.0`._

²: _You can require packages separately or if you only use the "testing" components, then replace this package with [`aedart/athenaeum-testing`](https://packagist.org/packages/aedart/athenaeum-testing) as dev-dependency and the mentioned packages will all be installed._

³: _You have to invoke `registerAsApplication()` explicitly to bind the `IoC` instance as `app`, should you require this during testing or outside a Laravel application.
**Warning**: do NOT invoke mentioned method if you are using the `IoC` within a Laravel application.
It will high-jack the `app` binding, which will cause your application to behave unfavourable._

### Fixed

* `Loader` fails to populate configuration correctly, adds initial directory path to each section.
  _This happens when relative paths are set as the loader's initial directory._
* `Applicaiton` instance not destroyed after `stopApplication()` invoked, in `ApplocationInitiator`.
  This resulting in `$instance` still containing reference to the application, inside Laravel's Service Container, causing tests to fail.
* `destroy()` does not flush bindings, in `IoC`. Instance is destroyed, yet formal Service Container `flush()` was not respected.
* Default values not triggered when invoking `toArray()`, in `Dto` and `ArrayDto`, when using aware-of traits to create a Dto class.
* `ContainerTrait`'s default value returns the `Facade` root application, instead of `Container`.
  (_Strictly speaking, this was not a defect. `Application` is an extended version of `Container`._)
* Headers option not initially set in `DefaultHttpClient`.
* Default return type of `MailerTrait` and `MailQueueTrait` (Laravel `v7.x` changed return of `Mail` Facade to `MailManager`).
* `withOptions()` incorrectly merged options, in `DefaultHttpClient` and `JsonHttpClient`.
  This caused strange behaviour, when attempting to overwrite an already set option.
* Http Client `Manager` does not use default profile name from configuration, it always returns "default", when no profile name given.

## [3.1.0] - 2020-01-01

### Changed

* Updated license

## [3.0.1] - 2019-09-29

### Changed

**Breaking Changes**

* Upgraded to Laravel `v6.x`, Symfony `v4.3.x` and upgraded various other dependencies.

### Changed

* Upgraded to codeception `v3.0.x` (_dev dependency_) and replaced deprecated assertions.

## [2.1.0] - 2019-04-14

* `\Aedart\Utils\Json` automatically sets [`JSON_THROW_ON_ERROR`](http://php.net/manual/en/json.constants.php) bitmask option, if not set
* `Aedart\Utils\Exceptions\JsonEncoding` now inherits from [`JsonException`](http://php.net/manual/en/class.jsonexception.php)
* Replaced deprecated `PHPUnit_Framework_MockObject_MockObject` with new `\PHPUnit\Framework\MockObject\MockObject`, in `TraitTester`

### Deprecated

* Deprecated `\Aedart\Contracts\Utils\Exceptions\JsonEncodingException`, will be removed in next major version
* Deprecated `Aedart\Utils\Exceptions\JsonEncoding`. Use native [`JsonException`](http://php.net/manual/en/class.jsonexception.php) instead
