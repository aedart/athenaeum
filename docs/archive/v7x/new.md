# New to this...

If you aren't familiar with Laravel, chances are good that most of the Athenaeum packages are somewhat confusing to understand.
That's completely okay.
In this chapter, you can find a few resources that can help you get started. 

## The Bare Minimum

Learning new technologies and frameworks isn't always easy, especially when time is against you.
If that's the case for you, then the bare minimum understanding you should gain, are the following few concepts:

- Service Container
- Facades
- Service Providers 

If you manage to learn about these concepts, you stand a far better chance of understanding how the Athenaeum packages work. 

## Laravel's Official Documentation

You could start by going through Laravel's [official documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x).
It has good and up-to-date information, on all the major aspects.
In particular, you should focus on [Architectural Concepts](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/container).
It contains everything you need to know, in order to satisfy the bare minimum.

## Or... Watch Laracast!

[Laracast](https://laracasts.com) contains some of the best video tutorials, that I know.
It contains over thousands of lessons, for beginners and experts alike.
It does **cost a bit of money**, but it is worth it¹.

¹: _I'm not paid for endorsing Laracast nor Laravel. I do so out of sincerity!_

## Other Concepts

There are many more concepts, components, packages, tips & tricks, all of which are worth knowing.
But, ... in all honesty, you should just _take your time_ learning the basics and toy around with it, before jumping into more complex areas.
