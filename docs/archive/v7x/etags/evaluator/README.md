# Introduction

[[TOC]]

## The Basics

The design philosophy behind the request preconditions `Evaluator` is to evaluate an incoming [conditional request](https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc9110.html#preconditions), e.g. `If-Match`, against the requested [resource](./resource-context.md).   

In general, when a precondition is evaluated either of the following will happen:

* When it passes (`true`):
  * Evaluator continues to evaluate another precondition (_if requested_).
  * Or it returns a changed [resource](./resource-context.md) (_e.g. a state change or perhaps entirely modified resource_).
* When it fails (`false`):
  * The request is aborted by throwing an appropriate `HttpException`, via an [`Actions` component](./actions.md).
  * The [resource](./resource-context.md) changed and returned.

All preconditions are evaluated in accordance with [RFC 9110's order of precedence](https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc9110.html#precedence).
See [supported preconditions](./preconditions.md#supported-preconditions) for additional information.

## How to Evaluate

Http Conditional Requests are always specific to the requested resource and the [Http Method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods).
It is therefore recommended that you evaluate the requested resource inside your [Form Request](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/validation#form-request-validation).
The following shows an example request:

### Request

```php
use Aedart\Contracts\ETags\HasEtag;
use Aedart\Contracts\ETags\Preconditions\ResourceContext;
use Aedart\ETags\Preconditions\Evaluator;
use Aedart\ETags\Preconditions\Resources\GenericResource;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Validation\Validator;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Http\FormRequest;

class ShowUserRequest extends FormRequest
{
    public ResourceContext $resource;

    protected function prepareForValidation()
    {
        // 1) Find requested resource or fail.
        $model = $this->findOrFailModel();

        // 2) Wrap it inside a Resource Context
        $resource = $this->makeResourceContext($model);

        // 3) Evaluate request's preconditions against resource...
        $this->resource = Evaluator::make($this)
            ->evaluate($resource);
    }

    protected function makeResourceContext(Model & HasEtag $model): ResourceContext
    {
        return new GenericResource(
            data: $model,
            etag: fn () => $model->getStrongEtag(),
            lastModifiedDate: $model->updated_at
        );
    }

    protected function findOrFailModel(): Model & HasEtag
    {
        // ...not shown ...
    }
}
```

### Route or Controller Action

In your controller or route action, you can then return the requested resource with [cache headers](./../macros.md#withcache). 

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;

Route::get('/user/{id}', function (ShowUserRequest $request) {
    $resource = $request->resource;
    $payload = $resource
        ->data()
        ->toArray();

    return response()
        ->json($payload)
        ->withCache(
            etag: fn () => $resource->etag(),
            lastModified: $resource->lastModifiedDate(),
            private: true
        );
})->name('users.show');
```

### Responses

Whenever a request without preconditions is received by your application, your application will return the requested resource, along with a few cache headers. 
For instance:

**Request (_without precondition_)**

```txt
GET /users/42 HTTP/1.1
```

**Response (_with cache headers_)**

```txt
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Cache-Control: private
Etag: "a81283f2670a78cd4c5a2e56cb0cd4ef5e357eb1"
Last-Modified: Sun, 15 Jan 2023 16:13:23 GMT
Content-Type: application/json

{"id":42,"name":"John Doe","age":31,"updated_at":"2023-01-15T16:13:23.000000Z"}
```

However, when a request contains a preconditions, e.g. [`If-None-Match`](https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc9110.html#field.if-none-match), then it is processed.
In the example below, the precondition fails because the etag value matches the resource's etag.
Therefore, a [304 Not Modified](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/304) response is returned. 

**Request (_with precondition_)**

```txt
GET /users/42 HTTP/1.1
If-None-Match: "a81283f2670a78cd4c5a2e56cb0cd4ef5e357eb1"
```

**Response (_If-None-Match precondition failed_)**

```txt
HTTP/1.1 304 Not Modified
```

The controller or route action is never executed. Instead, an exception is thrown and your application converts it into an appropriate response.
If the precondition had passed instead, then controller or route action would have been processed (_in this example_). 

## The Evaluator

You are free to implement the evaluation logic as you see fit, within your application.
The previous shown examples are only meant to demonstrate the general process. The rest is up to you.
To instantiate an `Evaluator` instance, invoke the `Evaluator::make()` method. 

The method accepts 3 arguments:

* `Request $request`: the incoming request.
* `string[]|Precondition[] $preconditions = []`: _(optional)_ list of [preconditions](./preconditions.md) to evaluate.
  * _Defaults to RFC 9110 + extension preconditions, when none are given._
* `Actions|null $actions = null`: _(optional)_ "abort" or "state change" [actions](./actions.md) instance.
  * _Defaults to a default actions instance, when none is given._

```php
use Aedart\ETags\Preconditions\Evaluator;

// Create evaluator instance (with defaults)
$evaluator = Evaluator::make($request);

// ...Or when you have custom preconditions / actions
$evaluator = Evaluator::make(
    reqeust: $request,
    preconditions: $myPreconditionsArray,
    actions: $myActions
);
```

Once you have instantiated an evaluator instance, use the `evaluate()` method to evaluate request's preconditions against the requested resource.
The method accepts a [`ResourceContext`](./resource-context.md) instance and will either return the resource (_possible changed_), or throw a `HttpException`. 

```php
$evaluator->evaluate($resource);
```

## Exception Handling

Whenever the `Evaluator` throws an exception, your Laravel application's exception handler will process it and create an appropriate response.
Please read [Laravel's exception handler documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/errors#the-exception-handler) for additional information.
