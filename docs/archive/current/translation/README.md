# Introduction

_**Available since** `v7.3.x`_

The translation package contains a few utilities for [Laravel's Localization utilities](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/localization).

## Exporters

Among the available utilities are [translation exporters](./exporters/README.md).

```php
$translations = $exporter->export('en', 'auth');

print_r($translations);
```

```

                )
            [auth] => Array
