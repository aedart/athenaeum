# Origin

## The Origin of Athenaeum

Some years ago, I started to develop packages and publish them via [packagist](https://packagist.org/).
The packages were nothing special. But, they helped me complete trivial tasks a bit faster, or perhaps in a more desirable way.
After a while, a few packages became many. Whenever I had to upgrade them, it took increasingly more effort and time.
In hopes of making things easier for myself, I reshaped all of my PHP packages into a [mono repository](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo) (_since version `v4.0`_).
Athenaeum become the chosen name for this project and has existed since then.
