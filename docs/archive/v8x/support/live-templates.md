# Live Templates

If you are using [PHP Storm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/), then you might find the `gst` [Live Template](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/phpstorm/using-live-templates.html) helpful.
It offers a quick way to implement Aware-of Helpers.
It is available in the [Athenaeum Repository](https://github.com/aedart/athenaeum/blob/master/.editor/Aedart_Athenaeum.xml), along a few other Live Templates (_that might not be as useful!_).

## Other IDEs

If you prefer other IDEs, and you are skilled at creating "templates" or "scaffolds", then please help out.
Share your version of a "Aware-of" template. Other developers will surely thank you for it :)
