# Pros and Cons

If you are a regular Laravel user, then you most likely have your own desired way of how to resolve / obtain dependencies.
Most likely, you either resolve these via the Service Container or rely on Facades.
There is absolutely nothing wrong with that and you should continue to do so, if it feels right.

As previously mentioned, these components are supplementary or alternatives - either they make sense for you to use or they do not.
In other words, you have to decide for yourself when and how to use these, if at all.
Should you do, then remember that they do add a bit of additional complexity to your components.
But it might just be worth it ...
