# Testing

Should you wish to write tests that specifically rely on the Athenaeum Core Application, then please see the [Testing package](../../testing) for additional information.

::: tip
You can always review the source code, inside the [Athenaeum Repository](https://github.com/aedart/athenaeum).
Perhaps they can give you some inspiration, on how to test components that rely of the Core Application.
