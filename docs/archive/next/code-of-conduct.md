# Code of Conduct

Be nice... be fair! Writing free Open Source software often means spending time developing after-hours, and in weekends.
Chances are pretty good that you yourself are involved in one or many Open Source projects and already know how time-consuming it can be. In any case, the following constitutes the code of conduct used by Athenaeum:

* Be patient, nice and fair.
* Be helpful and constructive.
* Your words and actions must be free of harassment, harmful deeds or remarks, and malicious intent.
* Respect the opinions of others, even if they contradict yours.

## Consequences

Participants can be subject to consequences, if the code of conduct is not upheld. Such consequences include, but not limited to, warnings, and banning from further participation.
