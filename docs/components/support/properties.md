# Aware Of Properties

Below is a list of default aware-of components that are offered by this package.
They are suitable for usage with the [Dto abstraction](../dto/README.md) or for situations where you require your components to be aware of some kind of property.

## Make You Own

If you cannot find a specific aware-of component, then you can [request a new component](https://github.com/aedart/athenaeum/issues).
Alternatively, you can generate your own, by using the available [Dto Generator](./generator.md), which has also been used to generate these components.

## Available Aware-Of Components

The following list are the available aware-of components.
